# Multiclass Fish Image Classification 

This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple species using deep learning. The workflow covers data preprocessing, training a custom CNN, applying transfer learning with multiple pre‑trained models, evaluating performance, and deploying the best model with a Streamlit web app for real‑time predictions.
